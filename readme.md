Don't Do That stops minecraft from being annoying.
Currently, it does the following things:
1. Prevents deletion of unknown options from your options.txt file
2. Stops the game from complaining about resource/data pack versions
3. Stops the game from complaining about dragons being here
4. Makes identifier suggestions suggest identifiers from all namespaces instead of just minecraft
5. Makes all keybinds bound to the same key work even if conflicting
6. Makes chat history a lot longer
